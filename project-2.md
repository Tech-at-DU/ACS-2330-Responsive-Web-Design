# Responsive Project 2

Your second project will be a website that you will build from scrtach or it can be an existing web site that you update. Here is a list of the requirements:

- Is repsonsive 
- Mobile first 
- Wire frames 
- Accessible
- UX Tested

## Is Repsonsive 

Your site should use repsonive design and media queries to adapt to a range of screen sizes from mobile to desktop. 

## Mobile First 

You should plan and design your site for Mobile platforms first and adapt it to other platforms using screen sizes using media queries and responsive techniques. 

## Wire Frames 

You must plan your project and draw it out using wire frames first! 

## Accessible

Your site should accessible. 

## UX Tested

You will implement a user experience test for your project and apply the results to your finished project. 

## Getting Started! 

### Create a site map

1. **Identify Website Goals**: Understand the purpose of the website and the key objectives it needs to fulfill. This will help in determining the main sections and pages needed.
2. **List Main Sections**: Identify the primary sections or categories that will make up your website. These could be Home, About Us, Services, Products, Blog, Contact, etc.
3. **Outline Subsections**: Under each main section, outline the subsections or pages that will fall within them. For example, under Services, you might have pages like Consulting, Design, Development, etc.
4. **Establish Navigation Flow**: Determine how users will navigate through your site. Design a logical flow of information starting from the homepage, through main sections, and into subsections.
5. **Use Visual Hierarchy**: Represent the hierarchy of your pages visually. Use indentation, shapes, or connecting lines to show parent-child relationships between sections and pages.
6. **Consider User Experience**: Ensure the sitemap reflects an intuitive and user-friendly structure. Pages should be organized logically, making it easy for visitors to find what they are looking for.
7. **Review and Revise**: After creating the initial sitemap, review it critically. Check for completeness, clarity, and consistency. Make revisions as necessary to refine the structure.
8. **Create Digital Version**: Once finalized, create a digital version of the sitemap using tools like diagramming software, graphic design tools, or sitemap generators available online.
9. **Share and Gather Feedback**: Share the sitemap with stakeholders such as clients, team members, or instructors. Gather feedback to ensure the structure meets the project requirements and goals.
10. **Update as Needed**: Remember that a sitemap is a living document. As the website evolves or requirements change, update the sitemap accordingly to maintain a clear representation of the site's structure.

### Write User stories 

1. **Role**: Start by identifying the user or role for whom the story is being written (e.g., "As a customer," "As an admin").
2. **Action**: Describe what the user wants to accomplish (e.g., "I want to browse products," "I need to update my profile").
3. **Outcome**: Specify the goal or benefit of the action (e.g., "So I can make a purchase easily," "To keep my information up-to-date").
4. **Format**: Write the user story in a simple template like: "As a [role], I want [action], so that [outcome]."
5. **Keep it Simple**: Focus on the essential details and avoid technical jargon or implementation specifics.
6. **Prioritize**: Rank user stories based on importance to guide development and prioritize features.
7. **Iterate**: Refine and update user stories as you gather feedback and requirements evolve during the project.

### Create your wireframes 

1. **Define Purpose and Scope**: Understand the purpose of the webpage or application and define its key functionalities.
2. **Identify Key Elements**: Determine the essential elements to include, such as navigation bars, content sections, buttons, forms, and media.
3. **Sketch Initial Layout**: Start with rough sketches using pen and paper or digital tools. Focus on positioning key elements and defining overall structure.
4. **Use Wireframing Tools**: Transition to digital wireframing tools like Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD, or wireframe.cc to create more refined layouts.
5. **Create Low-Fidelity Wireframes**: Begin with low-fidelity wireframes, emphasizing structure over visual details. Use basic shapes and placeholders for content.
6. **Focus on User Flow**: Ensure a clear and intuitive flow of information. Design how users will navigate through the interface.
7. **Iterate and Refine**: Gather feedback from stakeholders and team members. Revise wireframes based on feedback to improve clarity and usability.
8. **Add Detail**: Gradually add more detail to wireframes, incorporating typography, color schemes, and actual content where appropriate.
9. **Review for Consistency**: Ensure consistency in design elements and alignment throughout the wireframes.
10. **Finalize and Share**: Once approved, finalize the wireframes and share with the development team as a blueprint for implementation.
