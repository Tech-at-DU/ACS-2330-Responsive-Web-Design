## UX Test

---

### 1. Prepare - Test provider

* Write down **3–5 key tasks** you want users to try (e.g., “Find the checkout button”). The tasks should simple and focused one feature of your site. 
* Get a simple script ready: *“Thanks for testing! Please try these tasks and think out loud as you go.”*. The goal is provide background about your site without providing instructions. 
* Have a way to **take notes** (paper, laptop, or phone recording). Your goal is to collect data from this UX test.

### 2. Recruit

* Ask at least **3–5 people** (not on your team) to test your project.
* Try to choose people who match your target audience if possible.

---

### 3. Run the Test

* Greet the tester and explain: *“We’re testing the project, not you. There are no wrong answers.”*
* Give them one task at a time.
* **Don’t help them** unless they’re completely stuck — just watch.
* Encourage them to **think out loud** (“I expected this button to…”). User testers should "think out loud" say whatever is on your mind about the test. This is the most helpful thing you can do during the test!

### 4. Observe & Record

* Note what the user **tries first**.
* Record where they **hesitate, get confused, or make mistakes**. These are areas where your site might need improvement.
* Write down their exact words if possible.
* Track if they **completed the task successfully** or not.

### 5. Collect Feedback

After tasks, ask short open questions:

* *What was the hardest part?*
* *What was the easiest part?*
* *If you could change one thing, what would it be?*

### 6. Summarize

For each task, write down:

* ✅ What worked
* ⚠️ What confused users
* 💡 Ideas for improvement

---

### 7. Improve & Submit

* Pick the **top 2–3 issues** to fix first.
* Explain in your submission:

  1. What you tested
  2. What you learned
  3. What you changed
