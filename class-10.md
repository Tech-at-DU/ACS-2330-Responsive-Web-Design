## Lecture:

- Introduction to website performance and why it matters for user experience.
- Techniques for optimizing website performance, including minimizing HTTP requests, optimizing images, and lazy loading.
- How to use tools like Lighthouse and Google PageSpeed Insights to measure and improve website performance.

## Group Activity:

- In groups of 3-4, students will analyze a slow-loading website and identify the causes of the slow performance.
- Students will create a list of recommendations and share them with the class.

## Lab Activity:

- Using a slow-loading webpage as a starting point, students will implement techniques learned in class to improve the webpage's performance.
- Students will experiment with different techniques like image optimization and lazy loading to see the impact on webpage performance.

## Homework Assignment:

- Improve the performance of a slow-loading webpage by implementing at least three optimization techniques learned in class.
- Students should use tools like Lighthouse or Google PageSpeed Insights to measure the improvements in performance.

## Conclusion:

- Recap of the key concepts covered in class.
- Encourage students to continue exploring techniques for website optimization and to consider the impact of website performance on user experience.
