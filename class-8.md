# Mobile-first Design and Progressive Enhancement

Your goal for the last half of the class is to create a fully responsive website and accessible website. This project can start from an existing project, for example an intensive project, or be built from scratch. It should meet the requirements: 

- Mobile first design - You will plan this project using a mobile first methodology. 
- Must be responsive - Your site should scale and present itself well on mobile, tablets, and desktop. Stretch goal: take into account for tablet portrait, and extra wide desktops. 



## Mobile design considerations

On mobile things stack vertically and there is less available space. 

We view our phones most often in portrait and view port is taller than it is wide. We read horizontally and most of the information on the page is in text form. When you view a page on the phone all of the content is stacked vertically and you are scrolling vertically. 

Most often on mobile content will maximize the width taking up as much horizontal space as possible, without overflowing, while stacking vertically with excess overflowing. In this way we read short lines and scroll for more content, with images showing as much detail as possible. 

Pixels on mobile are generally smaller, or you could think about this as pixel density is higher, there are more pixles in a smaller area. This means that while the screens are crisp and look great everything on mobile is smaller. 

The input experience on mobile devices is unique. All touch based. If you think about your finger as the cursor notice that it often covers thing that you are interacting with. There is no hover effect on mobile. The cursor on the desktop is 16 by 16 pixels, the tip of your finger takes up rough a 40 pixel circle. On mobile all interaction happens on a smaller screen with a much larger and less accurate pointing device! 

## Desktop design considerations

On the desktop screens are larger. While we stack things vertically there is added space available to display things side by side.

### Group Activity:

1. Mobile Device Analysis (20 minutes):
	- Divide students into small groups
	- Each group will analyze a mobile device and identify its unique characteristics and limitations
	- Groups will then share their findings with the class

### Lab Activity:

1. Mobile-first Design Challenge (1 hour):
	- Students will create a new website design or modify an existing one with a mobile-first approach
	- They will use CSS media queries to add styles for larger screens
	- Students will use progressive enhancement techniques to add additional features for devices that support them

### Presentations and Feedback:

1. Design Review (20 minutes):
	- Each student will present their mobile-first design and explain their progressive enhancement approach
	- Feedback and critiques will be provided by the instructor and peers

## Lecture:

### Mobile-first vs Desktop-first Design (10 minutes):

- Differences between mobile-first and desktop-first design
- Advantages and disadvantages of each approach

## Lab Activity:

### Desktop-first to Mobile-first Conversion (20 minutes):

- Students will take an existing desktop-first design and modify it for a mobile-first approach
- They will use CSS media queries to add styles for larger screens
- Students will use progressive enhancement techniques to add additional features for devices that support them

## Wrap-up and Homework Assignment:

### Summary and Key Takeaways (10 minutes):

- Review of key concepts and techniques covered in the class
- Tips for applying mobile-first design and progressive enhancement in real-world projects

## Homework Assignment (5 minutes):

- Students will create a new website design or modify an existing one with a mobile-first approach and progressive enhancement
- They should experiment with different techniques and tools to enhance the user experience on different devices.
